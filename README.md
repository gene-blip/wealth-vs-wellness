WEALTH VS. WELLNESS: QUANTIFYING THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE ON GLOBAL HAPPINESS

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzes the 2015 World Happiness Report to determine what truly drives global well-being. By moving beyond raw economic metrics, I engineered a Social Strength Index to compare the influence of money versus community and freedom on a nation's happiness.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
1. Primary Driver: which factor between economic output(GDP) and social support has stronger statistical correlation with a country's happiness score?
2. Feature Impact: using predictive modelling, can we quantify how much a unit increase in social strength impacts happiness compared to a unit increase in GDP?

KEY INSIGHTS
1. Statistical Correlations
   The heatmap revealed that while GDP(0.78) is a major driver, Social Support (0.74) is nearly as vital for a high happiness ranking.

2. Linear Regression (predictive modeling)
   Model Intercept: 2.16
   GDP Coefficient: 1.32
   Social Strength Coefficient: 4.03

CONCLUSION
This model shows that Social Strength is 3 times more powerful than GDP. For every 1-unit increase in social factors, happiness rises by ~4 points, compared to only ~1.3 points for an equal increase in wealth.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Python (Pandas, Numpy)
2. Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
3. Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression Modelling)
